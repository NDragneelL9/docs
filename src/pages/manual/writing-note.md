The editor supports both standard Markdown syntax and the
[GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](/manual/markdown-cheatsheet) with inline formatting.

## Live preview

Inkdrop lets you preview notes to see how they will eventually look like. Use <kbd>Command+P</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl+P</kbd> on Windows/Linux to display note and its preview side-by-side.

Or click <img src="/images/icons/layout-two-colums.svg" width="20px" /> to toggle note and its preview side-by-side.
