The editor supports standard Markdown syntax as well as
[GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](/manual/markdown-cheatsheet) with inline formatting.

## Live Preview

Inkdrop supports live preview of note. You can switch to Side-by-Side Preview with <kbd>Cmd+P</kbd> (on macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+P</kbd> (on Windows/Linux) keybind to see the editor and preview side-by-side like this:

![SideBySide](./writing-note_sidebyside.png)

You can also toggle preview mode by clicking buttons on bottom right corner of the editor:

![Toggle buttons](./writing-note_toggle_buttons.png)

Note that those buttons are hidden unless you move the mouse cursor on the editor in order not to distract your writing.

## Distraction Free Mode

To hide the sidebar and the note list, press <kbd>Cmd+Shift+D</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+D</kbd> to toggle _Distraction Free Mode_.
You can even hide the toolbar on the top of the editor from the preferences if you don't need it.

## Tagging

Inkdrop lets you assign tags to a note.
This is another way to organize your notes.

Tags are listed on the sidebar.
