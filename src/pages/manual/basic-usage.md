## Inkdrop has three parts

![Layout](./basic-usage_screen.png)

* **Sidebar** (on the left): it lists notebooks, statuses and tags here. Notebooks are like folders you can create recursively. Statuses are additional information to treat notes as tasks. Tags are like labels which can link notes with related topic.
* **Note list** (in the middle): all your notes live here, ordered by modification date by default. You can search notes with keywords from a search bar on the top of it.
* **Editor** (on the right): this is where your magic happens; you're looking at it. ðŸ˜„

## Creating new note and notebook

To create new note, you can either push a button on the right top of the note list or input keybind `Cmd+N` / `Ctrl+N`.
