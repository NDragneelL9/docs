Inkdrop keeps your notes with revision history locally.
That means every time you saved a note after finished editing, the app creates new revision for the note.

If you accidentally made an unwanted change to a note, no worries.
The app provides a way to access old revisions of notes so you can restore them anytime.

**NOTE:** You can't access old revisions that have been made on other devices. Because Inkdrop syncs only the latest revision of your notes across devices. Inkdrop database erases old revisions automatically for saving its storage capacity.

## How to restore old revisions


1. Open up a note
2. Click *Revision History* button at the top right corner of the editor
