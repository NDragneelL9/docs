## Inkdrop cannot reset your password

For [securing your data](/security), your notes are encrypted and Inkdrop must need your password to decrypt your data.
This means that if you forget your login password, we cannot recover your data and we can't even reset your password.

But there is one way to recover your password, which is to check your computer system possibly storing your password.

<div class="ui error message">
  <div class="header">Inkdrop No Longer Stores Your Password In Your Computer</div>
  <p>
    As of v4.x which supports end-to-end encryption, the app no longer stores directly your password anywhere in local.
    So you can't recover your password from Keychain or Gnome Keyring.
  </p>
</div>
