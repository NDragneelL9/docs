## Steps to Publish Notes

First, click the three-dash button on the top right corner of the editor, or press <kbd>Cmd + J</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl + J</kbd> on Linux and Windows:

## Note

The note may not be correctly displayed on your browser if you opened too quickly after creating the public link as the synchronization of your database hasn't been completed yet.
Please try it again after a few moments.

Images on external sites are prohibited because of the security reason. Please use attachment images if you want to insert images in your notes.
