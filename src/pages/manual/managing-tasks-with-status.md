Inkdrop is a Swiss Army knife in the world of note-taking. One of its features is task management. It's possible due to the dedicated progress statuses. You can use statuses like 'Active' or 'Completed' to manage task-oriented notes easier.

## Add status to note

To add a status to a note:

1. Open the note that you want to mark with status.
2. Under the note's title, click **Status**.
3. Select a status from the list:
   * **Active**: Task is in progress.
   * **On Hold**: Task is on hold.
   * **Completed**: Task is completed.
   * **Dropped**: Task is canceled.
   * **None**: Initial status for all notes. Set this status if you don't want to track progress of a note.

## Filter notes by status

You can filter the notes by their statuses. For example, you can see how many tasks you've accomplished ðŸ’ª

To do this:

* On the sidebar, in the **Status** list, select **Completed**.  
  The note list shows notes with the 'Completed' status.

<div class="ui warning message">
Notes with the <b>Completed</b> and <b>Dropped</b> statuses are hidden in the note list when you view them via a notebook.
</div>
