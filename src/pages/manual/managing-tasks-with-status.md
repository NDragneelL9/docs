You may want to use Inkdrop as a task management tool if you write notes regarding your tasks.
Inkdrop allows you to add a status to each note.

To add the status to a note, click the status dropdown list to the left of the tag bar on the editor.

You can choose one of the status from **None**(default), **Active**, **On Hold**, **Completed** and **Dropped**.
The notes with a status of **Completed** or **Dropped** will be hidden in the note list by default.
